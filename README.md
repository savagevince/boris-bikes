Boris Bikes allows any person, by use of an app, to collect a bicycle from a docking station throughout London and pay for the hire from time of hire to point of re-docking at either the same docking station or any other docking station.  The docking stations must recognise the undocking and docking process and record the length of time of hire, and record any charges appropriately.
